Well. It's been 12 months, to the day, since I started working as a Software Developer at Esri. In those twelve months I have:
- learned from great mentors
- paired with the smartest workmates I've ever had
- constantly failed
- become a much better programmer

I'm glad Esri took a gamble on me, a semi-disciplined, largely inexperienced coder who had never been paid a dime to write a line of Javascript.
