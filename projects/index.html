<a href="https://secure-ridge-6206.herokuapp.com/">Heat Mapping</a> is the result of a 4 person group project at General Assembly. Our team looked to implement the Yelp API on top of leaflet. Once we hit our MVP, we played with some more advanced features (adjusting the starting location of the view, correlating circle color to entity rating, measuring total and average distance to all entities from search lat/long, etc...).
